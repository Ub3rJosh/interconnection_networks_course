2.9 Simulation:
Write a simple computer program to simulate our example network. Using this program, experimentally 
determine the network’s latency as a function of offered traffic. How do your results compare to the 
analytical results from Equation 2.3 and Figure 2.11? Also compare against the relative delay given 
by the queueing model
